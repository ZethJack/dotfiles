* Zeth's dotfiles
    =This is my dotfiles repository. There are many repositories like this, but this one's mine=
    Over the years of using arch linux I've been constantly tinkering and adding to my configurations. After wasting countless hours trying to reconfigure programs and utilities from scratch after every distro-hop or reinstall, I've come to a conclusion that having a convenient way to speed up the process might be a good idea...

** Installation
    Eventually I will write a bash script to automate this whole process, until then I will have to follow this process:
    - Install pre-requisities - on Arch:
      #+begin_src
      # Pacman -S chezmoi
      #+end_src
    - install the dotfiles using chezmoi:
      #+begin_src
      $ chezmoi init --branch $BRANCH https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles.git
      #+end_src
    - For =zsh= to work correctly, I install the =zap= plugin manager:
      #+begin_src
      sh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zap-zsh/zap/master/install.sh)
      #+end_src
    - to install =LunarVim=:
      #+begin_src
      LV_BRANCH='release-1.2/neovim-0.8' bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lunarvim/lunarvim/master/utils/installer/install.sh)
      #+end_src
    - to install =Doom Emacs=:
      #+begin_src
      git clone --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs
      ~/.config/emacs/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
      #+end_src
